Green Home Watch

The purpose of the Green Home Watch (GHW) is to bust myths about heating technologies and thermal insulation, and to collect real experiences from households. It is designed to help people make informed decisions about products and services in their area.

The GHW toolkit is a web-based decision support tool utilising the Google Maps API (or any other open Map base).  The toolkit integrates commenting functions at specific locations selected on a map by the user.  It also allows the user to choose a range of spatial data layers to overlay on the map.  Users can then begin a threaded discussion at a specific location.

It also runs location based questionnaires whereby user responses to particular policy issues (in our case renewable heating) can be presented and the user responses are then mapped by the toolkit. This allows others to see the responses to the questionnaire where location may have an important role to play in the deliberations over a particular policy issue.
